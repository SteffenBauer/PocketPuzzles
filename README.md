# PocketPuzzles

Port of [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) to the [PocketBook eReader family](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketBook)

To get a mostly complete collection for all puzzles ever written for the SGT puzzles, I'm planning to also include unofficial puzzles and puzzle variations from [puzzles-unreleased](https://github.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased) and [sgtpuzzles-extended](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/sgtpuzzles-extended), the unofficial *Group*, *Sokoban*, and *Slide* puzzles from the original collection, and the *Mosaic* puzzle from [here](https://github.com/kohend/simon-puzzles)

Inspired by and building on the work of [Port to Android by Chris Boyle](https://github.com/chrisboyle/sgtpuzzles) and [Puzzles for pocketbook by mnk](https://github.com/svn2github/pocketbook-free/tree/master/puzzles)

**11.8.2020 Major milestone reached!** Some games are now playable on a very basic level. 

**16.8.2020 Next milestone** Game control buttons now working. All games playable (but those using blitter / animations still need rewriting)

**6.10.2020 Alpha version ready!** Persistence of game params and current game now working. Most games UI are reworked suitable for eInk screen.

There is still work to do. See ToDo list below. eInk screens are limited in response time and color availability, so most of the games need individual tweaking to make them fun to play.

### Binary app

Connect your PocketBook with you PC with an USB cable. Copy `build/SGTPuzzles.app` to the folder `/applications` on your device. Unmount the USB connection, and reboot the PocketBook. You should now see an entry `@SGTPuzzles` among your apps.

### Build and Compatibility

Clone the [pocketbook SDK](https://github.com/blchinezu/pocketbook-sdk/) and set it up for the firmware of your device.

Modify the path to your local copy of the SDK in the `Makefile` at the line `PBSDK ?= ...`

Run:  
```
make
```

When everything compiles successfully, you find `build/SGTPuzzles.app`. Copy this to the folder `/applications` on your device. Reboot if necessary after transfer.

Tested only on the **PocketBook Touch HD 3**, because that is the device I own. Could possibly also work on other devices with firmware 5 or higher.
