Port of [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) to the [PocketBook eReader family](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketBook)

Work in Progress. First commit, only GUI framework functional, no actual puzzles implemented so far.

Tested only on the **PocketBook Touch HD 3**, because that is the device I own. Lots of hacking and reverse-engineering, as documentation for PocketBook app development is very, very sparse.

I'm planning to also include unofficial puzzles and puzzle variations from [puzzles-unreleased](https://github.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased) and [sgtpuzzles-extended](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/sgtpuzzles-extended)
