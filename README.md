### About

Port of [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) to the [PocketBook eReader family](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketBook)

I'm planning to also include unofficial puzzles and puzzle variations from [puzzles-unreleased](https://github.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased) and [sgtpuzzles-extended](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/sgtpuzzles-extended), and the two unofficial *Group* and *Sokoban* puzzles from the original collection.

Inspired by and building on [Port to Android by Chris Boyle](https://github.com/chrisboyle/sgtpuzzles) and [Puzzles for pocketbook by mnk](https://github.com/svn2github/pocketbook-free/tree/master/puzzles)

**11.8.2020 Major milestone reached!** Some games are now playable on a very basic level. 

**16.8.2020 Next milestone** Game control buttons now working. All games playable (but those using blitter / animations still need rewriting)

Lots of work still to do. See ToDo list below. eInk screens are limited in response time and color availability, so most of the games need individual tweaking to make them fun to play.

### Build and Compatibility

Clone the [pocketbook SDK](https://github.com/blchinezu/pocketbook-sdk/) and set it up for the firmware of your device.

Modify the path to your local copy of the SDK in the `Makefile` at the line `PBSDK ?= ...`

Run:  
```
mkdir build
make
```

When everything compiles successfully, you find `build/SGTPuzzles.app` in the build directory. Copy this to the folder `/applications` on your device. Reboot if necessary after transfer.

Tested only on the **PocketBook Touch HD 3**, because that is the device I own. Could possibly also work on other devices with firmware 5 or higher.
