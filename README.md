Inspired by and building on the work of [Port to Android by Chris Boyle](https://github.com/chrisboyle/sgtpuzzles) and [Puzzles for pocketbook by mnk](https://github.com/svn2github/pocketbook-free/tree/master/puzzles)

To get a mostly complete collection for all puzzles ever written for the SGT puzzles, I'm planning to also include unofficial puzzles and puzzle variations from [puzzles-unreleased](https://github.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased) and [sgtpuzzles-extended](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/sgtpuzzles-extended), and the *Mosaic* puzzle from [here](https://github.com/kohend/simon-puzzles)

### Development history

See [ChangeLog.md](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/PocketPuzzles/blob/master/ChangeLog.md)

**14.11.2020 Beta version ready!** Games can now be individually configured. All elements needed for beta are now implemented.

**6.10.2020 Alpha version ready!** Persistence of game params and current game now working. Most games UI are reworked suitable for eInk screen.

**16.8.2020 Next milestone** Game control buttons now working. All games playable (but those using blitter / animations still need rewriting)

**11.8.2020 First major milestone reached!** Some games are now playable on a very basic level. 

There is still work to do. See ToDo list below. eInk screens are limited in response time and color availability, so most of the games need individual tweaking to make them fun to play.

See [ToDo.md](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/PocketPuzzles/blob/master/ToDo.md)

### Binary app

Connect your PocketBook with you PC with an USB cable. Copy `release/SGTPuzzles.app` to the folder `/applications` on your device. Unmount the USB connection, and reboot the PocketBook. You should now see an entry `@SGTPuzzles` among your apps.

If you want the newest possible version build from the latest commit, use `release/nightly/SGTPuzzles.app`.

### Build

Clone the [pocketbook SDK](https://github.com/blchinezu/pocketbook-sdk/) and set it up for the firmware of your device.

Modify the path to your local copy of the SDK in the `Makefile` at the line `PBSDK ?= ...`

Run: `make`

When everything compiles successfully, you find `build/SGTPuzzles.app`. Copy this to the folder `/applications` on your device. Reboot if necessary after transfer.

### Compatibility

Tested only on the **PocketBook Touch HD 3**, because that is the device I own. Should principally work on all devices with firmware 5 or higher.

I received reports that the app works with these devices:

* PB632  - Touch HD 3
* PB631  - Touch HD / Touch HD 2
* PB740  - InkPad 3
* PB633  - Pocketbook Color
* PB1040 - InkPad X
* PB626  - Touch Lux 3 (see [#12](/../../issues/12) for possible issue, but should be fixed now)

I'm interested in reports from more devices; especially how it looks like on color screen and on devices with screen resolution different than the Touch HD 3.
