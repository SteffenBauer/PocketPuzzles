# PocketPuzzles

Port of [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) to the [PocketBook eReader family](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketBook)

[**Download the app here**](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/PocketPuzzles/blob/master/release/README.md)

Inspired by and building on the work of [Port to Android by Chris Boyle](https://github.com/chrisboyle/sgtpuzzles) and [Puzzles for pocketbook by mnk](https://github.com/svn2github/pocketbook-free/tree/master/puzzles)

To get a mostly complete collection for all puzzles ever written for the SGT puzzles, I'm planning to also include unofficial puzzles and puzzle variations from [puzzles-unreleased](https://github.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased), [sgt-puzzles-aho-extensions](https://github.com/Anders-Holst/sgt-puzzles-aho-extensions), and [sgtpuzzles-extended](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/sgtpuzzles-extended).

The unfinished puzzles from the official collection (*Group*, *Slide*, *Sokoban*) will not be included.

### Compatibility

Tested only on the **PocketBook Touch HD 3**, because that is the device I own. Should principally work on all devices with firmware 5 or higher.

I received reports that the app works with these devices:

* PB632  - Touch HD 3
* PB631  - Touch HD / Touch HD 2
* PB740  - InkPad 3
* PB633  - Pocketbook Color
* PB1040 - InkPad X
* PB626  - Touch Lux 3 (see note below)
* PB628  - Touch Lux 5 (see note below)

The app seems to work also on *Vivlio* devices, for further details see [this blog entry](https://www.liseuses.net/50-jeux-video-liseuse-vivlio-pocketbook/) (in french language)

**Please note** The app is developed for a device with screen resolution of 1072 x 1448 pixels. The app should be scaling according to the available resolution, but might have issues displaying certain UI elements on devices with a different resolution.

I'm interested in reports from more devices; especially how it looks like on color screen and on devices with screen resolution different than the Touch HD 3. When submitting an issue, please provide relevant screenshots.

### Binary app

See here [release/README.md](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/PocketPuzzles/blob/master/release/README.md) for already compiled app files ready for installation on a PocketBook Firmware 5 and higher device.

**Memory usage**: The app itself is around 1.5 MB. It additionally stores the game preferences and the status of the last played game in a separate configuration file, which is usually less than 100 KB. So in total the app will take the space of a few eBooks.

### Manual build

Clone the [pocketbook SDK](https://github.com/blchinezu/pocketbook-sdk/) and set it up for the firmware of your device.

Modify the path to your local copy of the SDK in the `Makefile` at the line `PBSDK ?= ...`

Run: `make`, or `make -j4` to compile parallel using 4 processor cores (adjust according to your machine).

When everything compiles successfully, you find `build/SGTPuzzles.app`. Copy this to the folder `/applications` on your device. Reboot if necessary after transfer.

### Development history

**Changelog after Beta release** see [ChangeLog.md](https://github.com/SteffenBauer/PocketPuzzles/blob/master/ChangeLog.md)

**14.11.2020 Beta version ready!** Games can now be individually configured. All elements needed for beta are now implemented.

**6.10.2020 Alpha version ready!** Persistence of game params and current game now working. Most games UI are reworked suitable for eInk screen.

**16.8.2020 Next milestone** Game control buttons now working. All games playable (but those using blitter / animations still need rewriting)

**11.8.2020 First major milestone reached!** Some games are now playable on a very basic level. 

There is still work to do. See ToDo list below. eInk screens are limited in response time and color availability, so most of the games need individual tweaking to make them fun to play.

### Important Note!

Lots of hacking and reverse-engineering, as documentation for PocketBook app development is very, very sparse.
