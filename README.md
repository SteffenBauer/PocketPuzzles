# PocketPuzzles

Port of [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) to the [PocketBook eReader family](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketBook)

Work in Progress. First commit, only GUI framework functional, no actual puzzles implemented so far.

Tested only on the **PocketBook Touch HD 3**, because that is the device I own. Lots of hacking and reverse-engineering, as documentation for PocketBook app development is very, very sparse.

Build and installation is completely **on your own risk**! You must be aware that this software could brick your device.
