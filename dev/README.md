## Local game development

This directory contains the necessary files to compile the games into individual GTK apps, for testing on the local development platform.

Tested under Linux Debian 10, needs a GTK2 and gcc/build-tools installation.

Just run `make`, or `make {GAMENAME}` when you want to compile only a specific game.
